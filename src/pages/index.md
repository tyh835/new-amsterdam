      We are a local bakery making handmade specialty bread, cakes, and cookies
      for over 25 years. Our baked good has no chemical or preservatives and
      baked fresh every day. We also carry many vegetarian selections (egg-free)
      , and healthy bread (sugar free, salt-free).


      We will be open during this coronavirus season to provide essential bread
      for families.  We take good care to sanitize and wash our counters daily
      and also practice mandatory social distancing.
